example 0
example 0. again
example 0. yet again
	I've decided that example 0 is the branch used for updateing this to studio/ example-based format changes. So, this was technically not an example addition... sorta
example 0. still. (added better link)
example 1
	almost definitly won't use, very limited
example 2
	was n/a. so, nothing added
example 3
	all the possible examples where the same as example 2. so also n/a
example 4
	all the possible examples where mostly the same as example 2 and 3, and the others where useless. so also n/a
Example 5
	same as Example 1. Litterally, it was just the other half of the pair, so it's the same set
example 6
	what I was looking for (well, I saw the one I needed while doing it, not sure if that's the one I downloaded...)
